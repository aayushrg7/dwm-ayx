### DWM

This is a DWM patches from [Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dwm-titus). I’ve tweaked and configured the patches to suit my personal workflow, but it’s simple enough for anyone to use.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/dwm-ayx
cd dwm-ayx
sudo make clean install
```

Add this to your `~/.xinitrc`

```
slstatus &
exec dwm
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installation, remember to adjust some keybindings to fit your use case.
